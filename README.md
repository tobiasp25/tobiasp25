### Hi there 👋

# I'm **Tobías Pagano** :grin:

I'm 18 years old, and I live in Argentina 🇦🇷. <br>

I like sports ⚽, music :notes:, reading :books: and watching series :clapper:. <br>

I'm currently on my last year at high school (*E.E.S.T N°7 "T.R.Q"* :school: :airplane:), and I want to study Multimedia Design :computer: :art: at college.

I consider myself a ***curious*** person 🤔 and interested in learning new skills 🧠.

My immediate goals 🎯 are learning frontend and web programming 🧑‍💻 and learning to play the guitar 🎸 ; and in long term I look for working on development and design projects :atom: and creating music 🎹.

Find me in
